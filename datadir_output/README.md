# Output data directory

This directory is used to store the output from the algorithm test-bench. It contains the following directories:

* `json_out` -- Store a JSON representation of the output from each run of each transit-detection algorithm.

* `mysql` -- Storage for the MySQL databases used by the test-bench. They are stored here and mounted into the Kubernetes cluster, so that database records are persistent when the cluster is restarted.

* `plato_wp36.log` -- Contains all log messages generated by the test-bench.

### Making a fresh start

If you want to start a fresh run of the test-bench, use the script `wipe.sh` to delete all output files and start again from scratch.
