# Transit-detection code collection

This directory contains a collection of Dockerfiles which build transit-detection codes into Docker containers. Each code has a subdirectory,
containing a Dockerfile which makes the container for running that code. Each
subdirectory also has a shell script which builds / installs the code.

All of these Docker images are derived from the core `plato/eas:v1` image which
contains the test-bench code.

Ideally the codes should be run in separate containers to eliminate any risk of
conflicts between them.  However, for diagnostic purposes, we additionally
include a master Dockerfile in this root directory, which builds all of the
transit-detection codes into a single Docker container.
